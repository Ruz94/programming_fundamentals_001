What does JSON stand for?
JavaScript Object Notation

What is the purpose of JSON?
It is used to pass data around, commonly from frontend to backend 

What does the package.json file do?
Holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify
the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a 
project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration
data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package.

How do you install dependencies in a project after first cloning it from Github?
npm install

What does "forking" mean in the context of Github?
Taking a copy of someone else's code

What data types do you know?
String
Int
Boolean
Null 
undefined

What is the difference between primitive and complex data types, and can you give examples of each?
A variable may store two types of data: primitive and reference. Data can be stored in variables and you can create variables by using keywords such as const or let.
You can access variables and manipulate the actual value stored in variables when created with the let keyword. For e.g.

let name = "Ruzina";
let age = 26;

Unlike the primitive value, when you manipulate an object, you are working on the reference to that object, rather than the actual object. In short, a variable that stores an object is accessed by reference.
To determine the type of a primitive value you use the typeof operator. For example:

let x = 10;
console.log(typeof(x)); // number 

What would be the best data type for representing whether a user is logged into the system or not?

How would you create a variable whose value could not be changed?

What would be the outcome of running this code?

const firstName = "Sandra";

function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + firstName);
}

sayHello("Sally");

outcome: Hello, Sandra

What would be the outcome of running this code?
function getFullName(firstName, lastName) {
  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
  return fullName;
}

const result = getFullname("Sally", "Jennings");

console.log(fullName);

outcome: undefined (fullName is scoped within the function body)

If you wanted to see what dependencies were required in this project, where would you to to look for a list?
package.json

When you install dependencies, what directory is created?
Npm modules

How can you write comments in your code?
// or /* */
